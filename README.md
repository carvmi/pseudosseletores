## Technologies 
- HTML
- CSS
- Git and Github

## What I have learned
- set max-width as 40em to let the design responsive.
- add "not(.sr-only)" on the property "span" to exclude the class "sr-only" or add "!important"  on all properties of "span[class~="sr-only"]"
- set "border-collapse: collapse" to allow the cell borders to be combined into a single border
- set a width (100vw) allow the elements to shrink to the container (or to fill the viewport) and set a max-width and min-width allow them to fix the width on it.
